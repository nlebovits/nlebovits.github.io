## Overview
I am developing a methodology to predict urban flooding probabilities using open source remote sensing data and deep learning models in Google Earth Engine. This work will inform a UN-Habitat initiative to help urban planners mitigate biodiversity loss due to urban and agricultural expansion.

## Data and Model
This work builds on a UN-Spider workflow that extracts flooding data for a given date, a paper on build a municipal flood index in Costa Rica, and two papers on building deep learning-based flood prediction models in Seoul and Brisbane. Data come via Google Earth Engine and are used to train a random forest model in Google Earth Engine via the Python API.

## Future Directions
Going forward, I plan to integrate Google Earth Engine with the `tensorflow` library in Python to develop a deep learning model. This will require me to create more robust training data and develop a more sophisticated, cloud-based workflow, but the the tradeoff will be that the model should be more precise.
