I used Google Earth Engine and global wetlands datasets to train a Random Forest model on Landsat 7 spectral images and assess wetlands change from 2000 to 2020.

My model achieved 95% accuracy and 65% recall, and suggests that the Iber√° wetlands have declined significantly in the past 20 years.

I put together a Python script in Google Colab, which is available with references here: https://lnkd.in/eNXq-QWg. I also put together a more high-level presentation on how remote sensing is used for wetland monitoring, which is available here: https://lnkd.in/eTsXvyMk.
