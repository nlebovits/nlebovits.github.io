For an independent study in applications of remote sensing for sustainable urban planning, I used Google Earth Engine and global wetlands datasets to train a Random Forest model on Landsat 7 spectral images and assess wetlands change from 2000 to 2020.

My model achieved 95% accuracy and 65% recall, and suggests that the Iber√° wetlands have declined significantly in the past 20 years.

Here, you can see my code in Google Colab:

<div class="embed-container">

</div>
```

Additionally, for a wetland ecology class, I put together a presentation on how remote sensing is used for wetland monitoring:

I also put together a more high-level presentation on how remote sensing is used for wetland monitoring, which is available here:
