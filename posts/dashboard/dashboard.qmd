Based on the work of [Dr. Eugenia South](https://www.urbanhealthlab.org/eugenia-south), I have been building a dashboard to help community organizations prioritize vacant and abandoned parcels for [anti-gun violence greening interventions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718503115). I am currently working to develop a more sustainable, accessible, and reproducible version of the dashboard with a combination of Python and JavaScript. I hope to launch a public version in the fall of 2023. In the meantime, you can see [an ArcGIS draft of the dashboard](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/551f77d85a584705b97c41db7711ba1b) that I made in November of 2022.
