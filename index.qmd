I'm a master's student in city planning at the University of Pennsylvania's [Weitzman School of Design](https://www.design.upenn.edu/), where I focus on environmental planning and spatial analysis. I work primarily in R, Python, and ArcGIS, and am currently learning JavaScript. Currently, I work as a research assistant for [Professor Allison Lassiter](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/allison-lassiter), for whom I'll be analyzing the impacts of sea level rise on vulnerable coastal drinking water systems.

I'm interested in using data to foster civic engagement and build more sustainable, inclusive cities. I believe in open-source tech and community-driven work. Check out my [projects](/projects/) page to see what I've been working on lately.

Previously I was an AmeriCorps VISTA with the City of Philadelphia, where I worked to support residents of the [West Philadelphia Promise Zone](https://www.phila.gov/programs/west-philadelphia-promise-zone/). Before that, I was managing editor for [Symposem Magazine](https://symposeum.us/), and before that, [I studied history](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/16300) at Vanderbilt University.
