I'm a master's student in city planning at the University of Pennsylvania's [Weitzman School of Design](https://www.design.upenn.edu/), where I focus on environmental planning and spatial analysis.

Currently, I work as a research assistant for [Professor Allison Lassiter](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/allison-lassiter), with whom I'm building a clustering model to identify vulnerable U.S. community drinking water systems. I also work for [Professor Matthijs Bouw](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/matthijs-bouw) on a UN-Habitat project that will help urban planners in the global south mitigate conflicts between urban expansion, climate threats, and biodiversity loss. I work primarily in R and Python, as well as JavaScript and ArcGIS. Recently, I've been using Google Earth Engine for machine learning applications.

I'm interested in using data to foster civic engagement and build more sustainable, inclusive cities. I believe in open-source tech and community-driven work. Check out [my work](https://nlebovits.github.io/projects.html) to see what I've been up to lately.

In 2021, I spent a year as an AmeriCorps VISTA with the City of Philadelphia, where I worked to support residents of the [West Philadelphia Promise Zone](https://www.phila.gov/programs/west-philadelphia-promise-zone/). Before that, I was managing editor for [Symposem Magazine](https://symposeum.us/), and before that, [I studied history](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/16300) at Vanderbilt University.
