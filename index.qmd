I am a Fulbright research fellow based in La Plata, Argentina, where I am investigating opportunities to use open source satellite imagery to improve local flood risk modeling. I have a master's degree in city planning from the University of Pennsylvania's [Weitzman School of Design](https://www.design.upenn.edu/), where I focused on environmental planning and geospatial data science.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant for [Professor Allison Lassiter](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/allison-lassiter). We built a clustering model to identify vulnerable U.S. public drinking water systems, and worked on a multi-agent system simulation of how saltwater intrusion might affect coastal drinking water supply networks. With [Professor Matthijs Bouw](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/matthijs-bouw), I also developed flooding and heat models for a UN-Habitat project that will help urban planners in the global south mitigate conflicts between urban expansion, climate threats, and biodiversity loss.

I am the founder of [Clean & Green Philly](https://www.cleanandgreenphilly.org/), an open source web tool that helps community groups in Philadelphia target vacant properties for place-based, anti-gun violence interventions.

I'm interested in using data to foster civic engagement and build more sustainable, inclusive cities. I believe in open-source tech and community-driven work. Check out [my work](https://nlebovits.github.io/projects.html) to see what I've been up to lately.
