I also work for Professor Matthijs Bouw on a UN-Habitat project that will help urban planners in the global south mitigate conflicts between urban expansion, climate threats, and biodiversity loss. I work primarily in R and Python, as well as JavaScript and ArcGIS. Recently, I’ve been using Google Earth Engine for machine learning applications.\nI’m interested in using data to foster civic engagement and build more sustainable, inclusive cities. I believe in open-source tech and community-driven work. Check out my work to see what I’ve been up to lately.\nIn 2021, I spent a year as an AmeriCorps VISTA with the City of Philadelphia, where I worked to support residents of the West Philadelphia Promise Zone. Before that, I was managing editor for Symposem Magazine, and before that, I studied history at Vanderbilt University."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For a floodplain management class in my first semester at Penn, I was interested in using citizen science data from eBird to explore conflicts between biodiversity and sea level rise. Follow the Cornell Ornithology Lab’s workflows for eBird data in R, I explored different ways of aggregating bird observations to a hex grid in Philadelphia, including trying to account for anomalous observations during COVID. Then I compared these data to projected NOAA sea level rise scenarios. I identified the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, Pennypack on the Delaware, and Bartram’s Garden as areas facing a particularly high threat by sea level rise to biodiversity. I also suggested that future efforts along these lines should focus on improving on the statistical rigor of this analysis and standardizing a streamlined workflow to allow for replication in Philadelphia and other cities, while also striving to interface with local government and community members to translate this model into concrete conservation efforts.\nMy full analysis is available on RPubs:"

    "text": "Illegal dumping is a major problem in Philadelphia. Especially in low-income, minority neighborhoods, illegal dumping has a significant impact on quality of life, property values, safety, and public health. My interest in illegal dumping dates back to my AmeriCorps years with the city, and is something I’ve explored in other contexts, including for Clean & Green Philly and in my illegal dumping dashboard built in R with flexdashboard.\nFor one of my assignments in my “Public Policy Analytics” class at Penn, I built two Poisson regression-based predictive models to mitigate selection bias in illegal dumping prediction. I incorporated spatial processes into one of the models and evaluted one using spatial cross validation. However, I found that neither model represented an improvement over traditional kernel density estimate-based hotspot prediction.\nMy full analysis is available on RPubs:"
