    "text": "I’ve spent this semester working on an independent study in applications of remote sensing for sustainable urban planning. For the first of two use cases, I tackled wetland change monitoring in Argentina using Landsat 7 imagery in Google Earth Engine. I put together a Python script in Google Colab, which is available with references here: https://lnkd.in/eNXq-QWg. I also put together a more high-level presentation on how remote sensing is used for wetland monitoring, which is available here: https://lnkd.in/eTsXvyMk. Next up: urban flood prediction in Costa Rica using a deep learning model."

I am currently working to develop a more sustainable, accessible, and reproducible version of the dashboard with a combination of Python and JavaScript. I hope to launch a public version in the fall of 2023. In the meantime, you can see an ArcGIS draft of the dashboard that I made in November of 2022."

I believe in open-source tech and community-driven work. Check out my projects page to see what I’ve been working on lately.\nPreviously I was an AmeriCorps VISTA with the City of Philadelphia, where I worked to support residents of the West Philadelphia Promise Zone. Before that, I was managing editor for Symposem Magazine, and before that, I studied history at Vanderbilt University."
