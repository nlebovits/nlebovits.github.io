Based on an independent study that I did in remote sensing applications for urban planning, I gave a guest lecture to Penn's graduate-level "deep learning applications for remote sensing" class. The lecture covered the basics of remote sensing, how remote sensing uses machine learning, and common applications of remote sensing for urban planning.
