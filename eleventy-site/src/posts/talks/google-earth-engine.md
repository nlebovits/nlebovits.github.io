Based on my work in Google Earth Engine for a UN-Habitat project, I gave a guest lecture to Penn's graduate-level "deep learning applications for remote sensing" class. The lecture covered the basics of Google Earth Engine; several examples of using GEE in JavaScript and Python for flood detection, land surface temperature mapping, and land cover classification; ways to extend GEE's functionality; and resources for learning GEE.
