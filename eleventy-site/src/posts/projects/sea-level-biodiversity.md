For a floodplain management class in my first semester at Penn, I was interested in using citizen science data from eBird to explore conflicts between biodiversity and sea level rise. Following the Cornell Ornithology Lab's workflows for eBird data in R, I explored different ways of aggregating bird observations to a hex grid in Philadelphia, including trying to account for anomalous observations during COVID.

Then I compared these data to projected NOAA sea level rise scenarios. I identified the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, Pennypack on the Delaware, and Bartram's Garden as areas facing a particularly high threat by sea level rise to biodiversity. I also suggested that future efforts along these lines should focus on improving on the statistical rigor of this analysis and standardizing a streamlined workflow to allow for replication in Philadelphia and other cities, while also striving to interface with local government and community members to translate this model into concrete conservation efforts.
