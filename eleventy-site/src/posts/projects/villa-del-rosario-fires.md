An analysis of fire data in Villa del Rosario, Argentina using QGIS, Google Earth Engine, and MODIS/VIIRS satellite data. This project involved setting up spatial databases, processing fire detection data from multiple satellite sources, and creating hexagonal grid aggregations to identify fire frequency patterns.

The work uses open source remote sensing data to help understand fire patterns and their impact on forests and communities in the region.
