<div class="home-intro">

I'm a software engineer and urbanist building open-source, cloud-native geospatial tools. My work focuses on using open data and new geospatial tech to help cities manage climate risks, especially in the Global South.

Major recent projects include:

- Technical lead for [Portolan SDI](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-cli), a tool to share geospatial data in a low-cost, accessible, sovereign, and reliable way.
- Core maintainer of [geoparquet-io](https://geoparquet.io/), fast I/O and transformation tools for GeoParquet files.
- A 2025 Fulbright research grant in Argentina, where I worked with small municipalities to see how they could use open data and cloud-native geospatial tools to manage climate risk.
- Founded [Clean & Green Philly](https://www.cleanandgreenphilly.org/), an open source, nonprofit tech platform that promotes data-driven interventions in vacant properties to improve quality of life in Philadelphia.
